to perform word tokenization on abstract.txt and outputs the results
too adetomiwaTokenizedAbstract.txt.

hw2Adetomiwa.py is a script for performing word sense disambiguation on
the sentences in cold_set.tx, to determine if they are referring to
cold in terms of sickness or low temperature. The results are output
too hw2OutputAdetomiwa.txt

bigram_frequency.py reads 1000 abstracts from random_1000 and identifies collocations
in the abstracts, ranking them by frequency. Bigrams with stopwords and non-alphabhets
