The mouse SYT IV gene maps to chromosome band 18q12.3, a region that defines a break point in the synteny with mouse chromosome 18 and has been implicated by associated SK-N-SH, SYT IV is an immediate-early gene inducible by elevated intracellular calcium and by forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase. The intraperitoneal administration of the DA receptor agonist, LY171555 (0.5 mg/kg, BW), inhibited the hyperlocomotion, and swimming behavior was transiently improved by the treatment with the 5-HT receptor agonist, 1-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride. These findings suggest that TN may play an important role in neurotransmissions related to behavior. These results account for the decrease in the inactivation rate as the reaction of 6-BDB-TAMP with the enzyme proceeds. Two naturally occurring mouse alpha-1, 2-mannosidase IB cDNA clones differ in three point mutations. Mutation of Phe592 to Ser592 is sufficient to abolish enzyme activity. Administration of recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) to mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (C.B.-17 scid/scid) resulted in an increase in YAC-1 lysis by their splenocytes as well as bone marrow cells. Rat synaptotagmin IV (SYT IV) is a depolarization-inducible synaptic vesicle protein.  We have previously demonstrated that transgenic (TG) mice carrying a truncated HMGI-C construct (HMGI-C/T) exhibit a giant phenotype together with a predominantly abdominal/pelvic lipomatosis. The predicted amino acid sequence of the human SYT IV clone is nearly 90% identical to the rat and mouse SYT IV proteins. A developmental analysis determined that mutants could first be identified on the basis of reduced body weight at day 15.5 of gestation.
